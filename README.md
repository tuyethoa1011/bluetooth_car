# bluetooth_car
My childhood dream present finally comes to reality ^^
- MCU used: STM32F103C8T6
- Support app coding platform: MIT app inventor (App to control car using Bluetooth 3.0 SPP standard)
- Current status: SW: App - Good, Firmware STM32 - Good | HW: Connector and overall design still not good at all in my opinion.
